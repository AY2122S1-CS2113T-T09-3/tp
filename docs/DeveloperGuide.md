### 2.2. Setting up the project on the computer
1. Clone **this** repo onto your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in welcome screen, click **`File`** > **`Close Project`** to close the existing project first).
3. Set up the correct JDK 11 for IntelliJ.
   1. Click **`File`** > **`Project Structure..`** > **`Project`**.
   2. Click the arrow drop-down button in **`Project SDK`**.
   3. Choose **`11 Amazon Correcto version 11.0.12`**.
   4. In the same dialog, set the Project language level field to the SDK default option.
   5. Click **`Apply`** and **`OK`**.
4. Click **`File`** > **`Open`** 
5. Locate and select the cloned project directory.
6. Accept all defaults as prompted by IntelliJ.

### 2.3. Running the program for the first time
1. Run the main SITUS program in `src/main/java/seedu.situs/Situs`.
2. Key in a few commands to make sure the program works.
>:exclamation: **Note**: Before proceeding with step 3, make sure all the contents in the file `data/ingredients.txt`
> are fully deleted. The Junit tests in step 3 will not pass if there are contents already in the storage file.
3. Run the Junit tests in `/src/test/java/seedu.situs` to make sure the programs passes all tests.


## 3. Design

### 3.1. System Architecture

![System Architecture](images/SysArch%20Diagram.png)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** above explains the high-level design of the application.


The App consists of 6 major components:
* `Main`: Initializes and connects the components together
* `UI`: Class that deals with the interaction with the user.
* `Parser`: Class that processes inputs and executes commands.
* `Command`: A set of classes covering the functionalities of the App.
* `IngredientList`: Class that holds the information of ingredients.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data

**Interaction between architecture components**

The _sequence diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other given a scenario where the user 
enters the input `add n/carrot a/1 e/2021-11-12`

![image](images/InteractionSeqDiagram.png)

Each of the 5 components (apart from `main`) can be found in their respective packages.

### 3.2 UI component

The **UI** component can be found in the `UI` package. The UI reads commands from the user, sends the command to `Main` to be executed and prints an output message upon completion of the command or if an error occurred.

### 3.3 Parser component

The **Parser** component can be found in the `parser` package. 

The package consists of the `Parser` class, which parses the command input by the user and executes the required `XYZCommand` class (`XYZ` is henceforth used as a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g. `AddCommand`).

### 3.4 Command component

The **Command** component can be found in the `command` package

The package consists of an abstract class `Command` and classes named `XYZCommand`. `Command` has only one abstract method, `run()`. All `XYZCommand` classes inherit from `Command` and implement `run()` to execute the corresponding commands. 

The class diagram below shows the relationships between `Parser`, `Command` and `XYZCommand`.

![image](images/ParserDiagram.png)

A quick overview of how a command is parsed and executed is as such:
* The command entered by the user is passed to `Parser`.
* `Parser` calls its `parseXYZCommand()` method with the command entered by the user as its parameter.
* `parseXYZCommand()` creates an instance of the corresponding `XYZCommand` class and calls its `run()` method.
* Thus, the command entered by the user is executed.

### 3.5 IngredientList component

The **IngredientList** component can be found in the `ingredients` package

Below is a partial class diagram of the `IngredientList` component

![image](images/IngredientListDiagram.png)

The `IngredientList` class 
* receives stored data(if any) from `Storage` when the first command is executed
* stores each group of `Ingredient` objects in `IngredientGroup`, grouped by their `name`
* sends the stored data to the `Storage` class for storage after command execution 

Each of the `Ingredient` objects contains information about an ingredient, namely its `name`, `amount` in stock and the `expiry` date.

### 3.6 Storage component

The **Storage** component can be found in the `Storage` package

Below is a partial class diagram of the `Storage` component

![image](images/StorageDiagram.png)

The `Storage` class
* loads/makes storage data file in memory when its constructor is called.
* has a public method to return the `ArrayList` of `Ingredient` type in the storage file.
* has a public method can take an `ArrayList` of `Ingredient` to write to the memory file.

The two public methods mentioned above are the most essential for the storage capablility of the program.
`IngredientList` object will only use `loadIngredientsFromMemory()` and `writeIngredientsToMemory()` methods
of the storage class only when there is a change in the ingredient list of the program.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. Alerts

Alerts are displayed automatically on startup, and when the user enters the command to display alerts. There are 3 types of commands:
* `alerts all`: displays alerts for both alert types below
* `alerts expiry`: displays alerts for ingredients expiring within a threshold number of days
* `alerts stock`: displays alerts for ingredients with stock lower than a threshold amount

The user is able to call any of the 3 methods on their own, while on startup, the `alerts all` command is automatically called via the `AlertCommand` class.

The sequence diagram for when the user inputs `alerts all` is shown below.

![image](images/AlertsAllSequenceDiagram.png)

All constructors for the command classes are called right before the relevant `run()` methods, as in `new XXXCommand().run()`. These are not shown in the diagram for simplicity. 

The `alerts all` command is passed into the `parser` class's `parse` command, which invokes the `parseAlertsCommand` method.

Next, an `AlertCommand` class is instantiated and `run` is called. This further calls 2 classes and runs them
1. The `AlertExpiringSoonCommand` class: Returns a list of ingredients expiring by a calculated date 
2. The `AlertLowStockCommand` class: Returns a list of ingredients with stock lesser than the threshold 

Each of the classes returns a String after `run`, which the `AlertCommand` class sends back to the parser to be returned.

The sequence diagram for the `AlertExpiringSoonCommand.run()` is shown below. The user can also call this via `alerts expiry`

![image](images/AlertExpirySequenceDiagram.png)

The current date is obtained via the `CurrentDate` class, with which the threshold number of days is added to obtain the threshold date.

The expiry date of `Ingredient` object in each `IngredientGroup` in the `IngredientList` class is taken and compared to the threshold date. 
The information of the `Ingredient` is taken note of to be printed when the function returns.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Update

On command, the `UpdateCommand` class instantiates it's `UpdateCommand` constructor with the input ingredient information.
=======
For `AlertLowStockCommand`, it is less complicated, and the sequence diagram shown below. The user can also call this via `alerts stock`
>>>>>>> 9ac62d704a800cb53eec8dfc24ebe0cd5e1c3d83

![image](images/AlertStockSequenceDiagram.png)

The `totalAmount` for each `IngredientGroup` in the `IngredientList` is obtained and compared to the threshold amount. The 
information of the `IngredientGroup` is taken note of to be printed when the function is returned.

## Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* manages food stock and needs to track a significant number of ingredients/ food items (e.g. a restaurant inventory manager)
* is proficient at typing
* is comfortable with CLI apps

**Value proposition**: track large amounts of ingredients simply through typing commands faster than a GUI driven application

1. Should work on any *mainstream OS* (Windows, Linus, macOS or Unix) with Java `11` or above installed.
2. Users proficient at typing should be able to complete tasks faster using commands than using a mouse with a GUI.

## Instructions for manual testing

### Setting up 
Refer to the [first time setup section](#2-first-time-setup) and follow the steps to run SITUS on your device. For the following sections, refer to the [user guide](UserGuide.md) for information on how to use the different commands.

### Testing features

#### Adding ingredients
1. Add ingredients using the `add` command with the correct format.
2. Use `list` to ensure ingredients you added are shown.
3. Test case: `add n/NAME a/AMOUNT` <br>
Expected: No ingredient is added and an error message is shown.
4. Try other incorrect add commands with different parameters missing <br>
Expected: Similar to previous.

#### Deleting ingredients
1. Use the same list from the previous section. 
2. Test case: `delete 0` <br>
Expected: No ingredient is deleted and an error message is shown.
3. Test case: `delete 1` <br>
Expected: The first ingredient is deleted.

#### Updating ingredients
1. Similar to adding ingredients, first use `update` correctly for an existing ingredient.
2. Next, test `update` with missing parameters <br>
Expected: No ingredient is updated and an error message is shown.
